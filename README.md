A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:


Tutorial-23:
Slider:
I have used ternary operator to set the strength of coffee. If _currentStrenght is 100, it will set to 100 for now but we will change it to userdata later on. If its not equal to 100 then set it to current value whatever is it. Same we do with the setting of color of slider. Left side starts with 100 which shows as light brown and goes darker and darker brown towards right.
